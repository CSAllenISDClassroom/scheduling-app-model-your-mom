During the beginning of our project, we researched numerous methods of source control, attempting to learn github early on, as we all had experiences numerous struggles with GitHub in our previous team project.
Initally we had planned on using a forking strategy, which actively involved the release manager to manage each inviduals branch that was forked from the release branch, and collecting them, and reviewing them to be in
the next release. We ended up not using the forking strategy,  but started using a strategy called Feature Branching. Feature Branching is when teams  will work in groups on a seperate branch dedicated for their
devlopment, and in which I would end up merging the branches, where I have to be consistently organizing the branches and communicating with my team to not make the process complex and merge eachc branch to make the ideal
functional release.
