# List of Features 



## Retrieve a Course List


### Functionality 
A list of all courses should be available for all users to see. The list of all courses should be stored within the database, and should be sent to the UI to display visually.  The scheduler appâ€™s front page will include a list of all courses. Each course should include a name, course code, available class periods, and the level of the course. In an ideal setting, the list of courses should include all of the primary functionalities, and also include GPA level, teacher names, semester credits, and campus. The course list should be well coded, non-complex, easily alterable, and expandable.

### Design
For this feature, the HTTP method is GET and there are no parameters or body necessary for invocation. The response would return a body that contains the JSON-formatted data for all of the courses and a HTTP 201 successfully created status code on completion. Some errors could occur if the request is unable to reach the server in the specified time.
