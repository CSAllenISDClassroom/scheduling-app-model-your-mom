## Return Conflict Warnings Based on Class Placement


### Functionality
When a class is added in the scheduler app, conflict warnings of any issues, if any, should be displayed. Clearly noticeable pop-up errors messages should be visible to the user. These messages should contain concise but crucial information to inform the user of any issues. Said issues include if a class is not available in a particular period, if a class is double blocked (back to back periods) and overlaps with another class, if consecutive classes have STEAM center and Allen High School campus time constraints, if the user selects privilege periods that conflict with already selected courses, and if dual credit courses become incompatible as they conform to a Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule rather than an A/B block schedule. The warning should contain the the name of the class or classes that have a conflict, the period of the class(es), and the name of any other classes that have a corresponding conflict.
