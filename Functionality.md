## Retrieve a Course List


### Functionality 
A list of all courses should be available for all users to see. The list of all courses should be stored within the database, and should be sent to the UI to display visually.  The scheduler appâ€™s front page will include a list of all courses. Each course should include a name, course code, available class periods, and the level of the course. In an ideal setting, the list of courses should include all of the primary functionalities, and also include GPA level, teacher names, semester credits, and campus. The course list should be well coded, non-complex, easily alterable, and expandable.

### Design
For this feature, the HTTP method is GET and there are no parameters or body necessary for invocation. The response would return a body that contains the JSON-formatted data for all of the courses and a HTTP 201 successfully created status code on completion. Some errors could occur if the request is unable to reach the server in the specified time.

Said issues include if a class is not available in a particular period, if a class is double blocked (back to back periods) and overlaps with another class, if consecutive classes have STEAM center and Allen High School campus time constraints, if the user selects privilege periods that conflict with already selected courses, and if dual credit courses become incompatible as they conform to a Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule rather than an A/B block schedule. The warning should contain the the name of the class or classes that have a conflict, the period of the class(es), and the name of any other classes that have a corresponding conflict.
